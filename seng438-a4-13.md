# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
Selenium is used for GUI testing. In this lab, we were asked to test one of three websites: Costco.ca, Amazon.ca, or Ikea.ca. After close inspection and simple testing of each website, we chose to test Costco.ca in this assignment. The simple, minimal design of the Costco website really helped the test run smoothly without many errors. Ikea.ca was also a good website to implement Selenium testing, but in some cases, when starting to record a new test, Selenium might take the tester to Ikea.com, even though we entered www.ikea.com/ca/en/ as our testing website.With Amazon.ca, the website is too complicated and has many dynamic objects and algorithms involved. When testing simple search functions, the search results might differ each time based on the current user settings. Additionally, due to the complicated website design, Selenium often freezes and stops responding. This has happened multiple times, preventing us from conducting any search-related GUI testing on Amazon.ca.
"The GUI test for Costco.ca aims to test basic day-to-day use cases. Initially, we tested functions related to the login process, such as logging in with incorrect information and logging out.Compared to Amazon.ca, Costco's search function is more straightforward and pages load quickly without any unresponsiveness issues. We have also added tests for searching and adding to the shopping cart. Additionally, we have designed a few test cases for useful links on the website. We made sure that contact information and necessary policies can be found on the website, and when clicking on them, they link to the correct page with accurate information.
