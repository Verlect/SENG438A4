# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
Selenium is used for GUI testing. In this lab, we were asked to test one of three websites: Costco.ca, Amazon.ca, or Ikea.ca. After close inspection and simple testing of each website, we chose to test Costco.ca in this assignment. The simple, minimal design of the Costco website really helped the test run smoothly without many errors. Ikea.ca was also a good website to implement Selenium testing, but in some cases, when starting to record a new test, Selenium might take the tester to Ikea.com, even though we entered www.ikea.com/ca/en/ as our testing website.With Amazon.ca, the website is too complicated and has many dynamic objects and algorithms involved. When testing simple search functions, the search results might differ each time based on the current user settings. Additionally, due to the complicated website design, Selenium often freezes and stops responding. This has happened multiple times, preventing us from conducting any search-related GUI testing on Amazon.ca.
"The GUI test for Costco.ca aims to test basic day-to-day use cases. Initially, we tested functions related to the login process, such as logging in with incorrect information and logging out.Compared to Amazon.ca, Costco's search function is more straightforward and pages load quickly without any unresponsiveness issues. We have also added tests for searching and adding to the shopping cart. Additionally, we have designed a few test cases for useful links on the website. We made sure that contact information and necessary policies can be found on the website, and when clicking on them, they link to the correct page with accurate information.

For GUI testing, the Selenium software felt outdated and not really suitable for newer webpages with a lot of functionality. As mentioned above, Selenium often freezes and becomes unresponsive when running tests in certain circumstances.
Selenium also does not come with an auto-save or quick save feature, and it is very easy to close the software by accident. When this happens, Selenium does not prompt the user to save before closing. Therefore, it is possible for a tester to lose all of their test cases if the software is accidentally closed (not if that this has happened to me).
In addition, Selenium does not isolate the test environment. It will run on the current browser settings, including whether an account is already logged in or if there are items in the shopping cart. This is a bit of a hassle as it might allow the same test cases to run under different settings and generate different results.
